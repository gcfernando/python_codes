This code uses the OpenCV library in Python to transform a regular image into a cartoon-like image. It begins by importing the required library and then reads an input image, resizing it to a desired size. The image is processed through a series of steps, including converting it to grayscale, applying a median blur to reduce noise, and detecting edges using adaptive thresholding. Finally, a bilateral filter is used to smooth the image while preserving the edges. The resulting cartoon-like image is displayed alongside the original image for comparison.
