This code creates a desktop application that converts text into speech. The main purpose of the app is to allow users to input text, select a language, and listen to the text being read aloud. The user interface is designed with a modern, dark theme, providing a clean and easy-to-use experience.

Upon opening the application, the user is greeted with a window that contains a textbox where they can type the text they want to convert into audio. There's also a dropdown menu for selecting the language in which the text will be spoken, with a variety of language options available, such as different English dialects (e.g., US, UK, Australia), as well as other languages like French, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Once the text is entered and a language is chosen, the user can press the "Play" button to generate the audio. The application will convert the text to speech and play the audio using a built-in audio player. There's also a "Reset" button to clear the text input, and an "Exit" button to close the app.

The underlying technology uses text-to-speech conversion powered by Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), with audio playback handled by the pygame library. If no text is entered or the input is invalid, the app will prompt the user to correct it.

In essence, this app is a simple and effective tool for converting written text into spoken words, supporting multiple languages with a user-friendly interface.
