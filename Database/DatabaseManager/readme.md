This Python script manages a small file where it saves and retrieves personal information. It first creates or opens a file called user.db, then stores details such as the person's first name, last name, age, and country. After saving the information, the script reopens the file, reads the details, and puts them together into a friendly introduction. Finally, it prints out a message that introduces the person, including their name, where they live, and their age.
