The provided code demonstrates how to scan and retrieve information about Wi-Fi networks using Python. It utilizes a library to interact with the Wi-Fi interface and perform the scanning operation. It retrieves details such as the SSID (network name), BSSID (network MAC address), signal strength, frequency, security mode, and authentication mode of each network. The code iterates over the scan results and prints these details for each network. It also handles any exceptions that may occur during the process.
