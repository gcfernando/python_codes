The provided code is a basic example that demonstrates the use of error handling in Python. It shows how to define a custom error message and raise it under certain conditions using a specific syntax. By incorporating try-except blocks, the code allows for the catching and handling of these errors in a controlled manner. This approach ensures that when unexpected situations occur during program execution, the code can gracefully handle them and provide meaningful information to the user or developer.
