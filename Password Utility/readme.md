Password Generator, a function is defined to generate a password. It takes parameters for the desired length of the password, the number of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters to include. The function randomly selects characters from different character sets to construct the password, ensuring that the total number of characters matches the desired length. The generated password is shuffled for randomness and returned.

Password Strength Validator, a function is implemented to assess the strength of a password. It takes a password as input and evaluates its strength based on the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The function calculates the total number of possibilities for each character type and determines the strength of the password based on predefined thresholds.
