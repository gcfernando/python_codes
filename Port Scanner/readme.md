The provided code demonstrates a simple port scanning implementation in Python. It uses socket operations to check the status of ports on a given IP address. The code defines a function that attempts to establish a connection to each port within a specified range. If a connection is successful, it indicates that the port is open, and if not, it indicates that the port is closed. The code loops through the port range, calling the function for each port, and prints the results. This implementation offers a straightforward way to perform port scanning in Python without relying on external libraries or advanced functionalities.
