Mangoes are a tropical fruit known for their sweet, juicy flesh and a large, flat seed in the middle. They have a smooth, thick skin that ranges in color from green to yellow or red. Mangoes are rich in vitamins, particularly vitamin C, and are enjoyed fresh, in smoothies, or as part of various dishes.
