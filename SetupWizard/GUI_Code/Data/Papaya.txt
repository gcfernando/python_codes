Papaya is a tropical fruit with a pear-like shape, known for its vibrant orange flesh and numerous small black seeds. Its flavor is mildly sweet and buttery, and it's often eaten raw, used in salads, or blended into smoothies. Papayas are rich in vitamins, particularly vitamin C, and digestive enzymes like papain.
