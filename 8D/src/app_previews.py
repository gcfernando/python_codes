"""The main window, part: previews: a short, temporary listen before creating.

A preview has three states the user sees: Preview (nothing playing), Preparing…
(the sample is being made; pressing it again cancels) and Stop (it is playing).
Only one preview is made at a time; the files live in a private temporary
folder (see previews.py) and are deleted when no longer needed.
