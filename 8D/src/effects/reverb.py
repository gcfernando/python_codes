# Developed by Gehan Fernando
"""A small, natural-sounding room made from scratch and played by FFmpeg's afir.

The room is an impulse response: a pre-delay, a handful of early reflections,
then a smooth tail that dies away and gets duller as it does, like a real
room where soft furnishings swallow the high notes first. Each ear gets a
differently seeded tail, which makes the reverb wide and enveloping.
