# Developed by Gehan Fernando
"""A simple model of your head: how each ear hears a sound from a given direction.

Three cues make a sound seem to sit somewhere around you:

- Time: sound reaches the near ear first, up to about 0.66 ms earlier
  (Woodworth's formula). This matters most below about 1.2 kHz.
- Level: your head shadows the far ear, a little for low notes and more and
  more as the pitch rises (Brown and Duda's spherical-head model).
- Colour: from behind, your outer ear dulls the top end; from above, a band
  around 7 kHz gets brighter (Blauert's directional bands).

The movement is carried by gains that change 200 times a second. FFmpeg
applies them to fixed delay taps and frequency bands, so there are never
any clicks, comb filters or time-varying filters.
