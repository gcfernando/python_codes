# Developed by Gehan Fernando
"""Opens Audio8D in Windows Terminal instead of the old Command Prompt window.

Double-clicking `__main__.py` (or dropping a song on it) makes Windows open
the classic console window, which draws colours and progress bars poorly.
When that happens and Windows Terminal is installed, Audio8D starts itself
again in a Windows Terminal tab and quietly closes the old window.

It never moves a session you started yourself: if you typed the command in
PowerShell, Command Prompt or VS Code, it stays exactly where it is.
