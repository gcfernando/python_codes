"""The song list behind the window: search, filter, sort, group and bulk styles.

Everything a big batch needs lives here, apart from the widgets, so 300 songs
cost the same thinking as 10 and every rule can be tested without a screen:

* every song follows the default style unless it has a style of its own
  (an "override"); there is never a third state;
* giving a song the default style simply removes its override;
* style suggestions are worked out once per song (and again only when the
  song's details, its described mood or the list of styles change).
