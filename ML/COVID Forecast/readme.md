The provided code performs time series analysis and forecasting on COVID-19 daily cases data for a specific country (India or Brazil). It uses libraries such as pmdarima, statsmodels, and matplotlib to implement the forecasting process.

The code first initializes variables for the forecasting, including the number of forecast steps, frequency, country, file name, index column, and title. It checks if the data file exists and if not, it downloads the data for the specified country, renames columns, fills null values, and saves the data to a CSV file.

Next, the code loads the data, applies data preprocessing steps such as detrending and differencing, and performs a stationarity test using the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. It also visualizes the rolling mean and standard deviation.

The code then uses the auto_arima function from pmdarima to automatically determine the optimal parameters for the SARIMAX model. It fits the SARIMAX model to the data using statsmodels and generates a summary of the model.

The code provides a static forecast by predicting future values based on the last 120 days of data. It also provides a forecast for the specified number of steps using the get_forecast method of the fitted model. The forecasted values are plotted along with the confidence intervals.

Overall, the code performs time series forecasting and provides insights into the COVID-19 daily cases data for the specified country.
