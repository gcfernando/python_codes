The provided code utilizes various Python libraries to generate a word cloud from the text extracted from multiple web pages. It uses the PIL library to work with images, the inscriptis library to extract text from HTML content, the wordcloud library to create the word cloud, and the requests, numpy, urllib.request, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries for various supporting tasks.

The code retrieves the content of multiple web pages, extracts the text from them, and concatenates the extracted text. It then creates a mask image and defines stopwords. A WordCloud object is instantiated with various parameters to customize its appearance and behavior. The generate method is called on the WordCloud object to generate the word cloud.

Finally, the code uses matplotlib.pyplot to display the generated word cloud image. It sets the figure size, face color, and edge color, and uses the imshow function to show the word cloud image.
